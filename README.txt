For this project, we downloaded a google chrome webdriver that is automated by selenium. You can find that here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Next, you must download all of the following packages if you do not already have them:

-scikit-learn
-BeautifulSoup4
-csv
-Pandas
-matplotlib
-mplcursors
-time
-selenium
-lxml

Once you have all the necessary packages installed, simply go to the directory where this project is located on your computer and type

python k_means.py

to run the code. This will run the kMeans algorithm on the shooting_stats_cleaned.csv file and then plot the values. If you would like to change the number of Principal Components or clusters,
you must manually go into the code and change those values.
